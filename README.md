# ODSL | Organized Data Storage Library

This storage library is built to make serialization and deserialization easy for anyone. It comes with some pre-built keyless and named serializables for libgdx and cosmic-reach with the extestions `-libgdx` and `-cosmicreach` at the end of the base maven/gradle dependency.
This library has 2 basic keyless & named binary serializers and deserializers that have been prioritized and optimized as much as I could, It also comes with built-in option for GZIP compression when coverting to bytes for each serializer.
